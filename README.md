# UI-Mockup-Groups-Lib-Demos-
A collection of demos that illustrate how to use my groups library and shows off its capabilities.


### IMPORTANT
You must download **rj_groups.lua** at [my "Groups Library" repository](https://github.com/Roland-J/Groups-Library/blob/main/rj_groups.lua) and place it in your **windower/addons/libs** folder. This demo requires it as a dependency.
